# Content Insights
I found knowning how to use CSS makes customize easier as you only have put in the id of the class you want to edit than compared to just using settings to edit it. Another thing I learned are pulgins, the pulgins allow more function to the website, which in turn make developing the website more time cosumsing but easier to manage at the same time.  

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
After complteting the practical, I started to look in other functions that wordpress in partically how to create a disscuion board. I learned the difference between a fourm and disscuion board which was useful when I was creating community page. I also looked more in too Joomla to understand functions in order to compare it Wordpress as I belive this knowldge would come in handly for the assigment.
