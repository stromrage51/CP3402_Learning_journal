# Estimated Hours

In total spent four learning about php. Spent two hours watching the lecture videos. Then spent two hours comparing the lecture slides on php to previous work done on other programming languages.      

# Content Insights
In hindsight the php programming was made much easier by watching the lecture slides I was able to compare the php language to PyCharm as both programming languages are quite like one and another. The lecture slides on PHP helped me further compare the php language to other programming languages and because of that I was able to get an idea on what to make to demonstrate to showcase the different features of php programming. The “if statements” of php are remarkedly like other programming languages, while “echo” acts like a print statement the console and on the website.
