# Content Insights
In hindsight the php programming was made much easier by watching the lecture slides I was able to compare the php language to PyCharm as both programming languages are quite like one and another. The lecture slides on PHP helped me further compare the php language to other programming languages and because of that I was able to get an idea on what to make to demonstrate to showcase the different features of php programming. The “if statements” of php are remarkedly like other programming languages, while “echo” acts like a print statement the console and on the website. The function class was also like other functions class on other programming languages platforms. Overall comparing the php language in slides to other programming languages made things easier as I was able to use experience on other programming languages to help me. The only difference was including html language as well on the php files.
