The easy and most expensvie part of the assigment was hosting wordpress there were many youtube tutorials on how to setup and host a website. The hard part was trying to work out how to make the first page of my website the same as the one on Joomla but better. My recommandtions for this prac would be improve on how to use "WordPress" for the assigment.

# Estimated Hours

I spent about the entire Sunday, Tuesday and Friday in my own time trying to upload my html to Joomla. Before releazie that it is possible but very diffulcut to do.

I spent the entire Friday afternoon from 2 pm - 6 pm, thursday and Friday morning trying to understood wordpress, I would have looked at it sooner but I determined to complete some other work. 

# Content Insights

I am very gratefull for this practical as having the knownedgle on how to upload a website to Joomla would be essitinal for creating further websites and hosting them. I relazie how good are CMS are as they create the files necessary to upload a html to Joomla.This would make further endvanours for mkaing websites much more easier my only regert is that i wished I knewn a much more easier way to use visual studio in connection my Joomla.  

I am so gald to learn about "WordPress" as so far it was easier to host than "Joomla" and somewhat easier to use as cms as well. "WordPress" has a lot more support than "Joomla" there are more tutorials and siteground seems to support "WordPress" as well. Learning how to host a website with "WordPress" makes future websites being hosted easier. During this practical i learned how "BootStrap" can be used in "WordPress" with pulgins which would allow me to have a offline copy of the website on my personal drive rather than being on "WordPress" only. My regert is that I beinging to scarth the surface of this amazming "open-source content management system" or CMS for short. Hosting a website is easy thx to siteground.  


# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
This practical in my opinion will give me a understand on how to start off the assigment as used to this practical to start on my website.
