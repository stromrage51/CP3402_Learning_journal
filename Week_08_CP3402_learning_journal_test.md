# # Hypothesis: 
I hypothesize that doing all the study for subject content for that week over a period of time with breaks would be a more effective method of studying instead all at going through all of the content with no breaks. 
# # Background: 
 The reason why this hypothesis was created is based on past experience I had in times of studying, when I am studying I attend to go all out, in a single time period however there are periods where I struggle to understand something no matter how hard I try and its only after give up on it and about 20 minutes later I realized what the content was saying. This suggests that having a break helps sort out what you were learning, so only breaks during a study session is beneficial over having no breaks. So, this hypothesis was made to confirm this theory or disapprove it. 

# # Test:  
    1.	Pre-test: Before starting the experiment, it is important to pick a specific topic and make sure what is currently known about that specific topic. In this scenario I chose data mining content week 7 and 8, I wrote down what I currently known now and used the online to test my knowledge. 

    2.	Study: I divide the content in two parts the first half of the content is given to the first method which was (“study for subject content for that week over a period of time and with breaks”) the other half of the content is dedicated to the other test “same content but without no breaks”, both methods were given unlimited time and time ended once content was sorted through. In this scenario the data mining content for week 7 video given to first studying method mentioned and second test method had week 8 content video. 

    3.	The study test: Both tests used the same method written down all the content from a lecture video in a book, one test was allowed breaks everyone hour an another wasn’t the test didn’t end until all of content was written down then was done. 

    4.	Test-end: After the end of the studying used a test to determine which studying method was better. For this case used to the JCU online weekly quiz for week 7 and 8 scores to measure the tests methods. 


# # Results:
Scored two marks more for test method 1 (“study for subject content for that week over a period of time with breaks”) than the seconded test method (“same content but without no breaks”). 

# # Conclusion: 
It appears that studying method 1 (“study for subject content for that week over a period of time with breaks”) was an more successful method of studying over the old second method (“same content but without no breaks”), as seen by the results.    

# Estimated Hours

I spent about the 2 days to test learning method.  


# Content Insights
After conducting this experiment, I realized that having breaks into my study routine does help to better long-term memory of information. Have a break from trying to studying is good method of study as helps clears one thought and come back with a new look and trying to understand something.  

This experiment highlights the importance of taking a break every now and then as it is good for studying as person can rethink what the content they are stuck on with new ideas. Moving forward, I plan to use this study method to have a better understanding on the different topics for uni. 

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
The results of this experiment highlight the importance of taking a break, as it is important when doing studying. This new method of studying will also be important outside university’s as it helps people who needed studying for different activities such as studying for work safety. Plan to leverage active recall techniques like pacing myself when studying.
