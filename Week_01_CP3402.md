# Pratical 1 
Name: Matthew Ballarino

# Learning Activities

During the practical and spent an entire week learning about creating websites. I learned about the different functions for html and learned about is CSS and how to connect the two files. I reckon this practical was a good as it teaches the basics of html and CSS. Also having the information learnt during the practical would be useful in the group assignment as it gives me the knowledge of need for the group assignment in order to not be a burden to the team.

# Estimated Hours

I spent about the entire week in my own time relearning everything I can about html and CSS. 

# Content Insights

This practical give me an understanding on html, yes it was confusing at times but I managed to understand on how html works and learn about CSS is. It took we while to understand the content but my classmates helped me understand CSS. What I am trying to say is that there better ways on trying to understand things rather than stumble along the way using outdated information on websites, sometimes its better to suck up your pride and ask for help and to work out for ourself. It also taught me some of information on “Insight” and “ww3 School” won’t help sometimes. I also learned that html is very different from python but similar to java but still very different. 

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
This practical in my opinion will give me a understand on how html works. My only regert is that I couldn’t work the nav dropdown bar. I learned the bootstrap is execellent source to find componets and templates when making a static website.
