# Learning Activities
This week I created a local website that is based on Prac 01 html website, the CSS code of html website was converted to SaaS which includes having variables, nesting, mixins and extend/inheritance. I learned from the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a5j7KoflTs Sass Tutorial for Beginners - CSS With Superpowers how to do the compiler which was needed to convert the SaaS code to CSS code in the main.css file. I learned from the lecture slides about SaaS variables which allowed easier changes to made to the CSS code due to easier access they are generally used for colours and font sizes. While SaaS nesting, I learned helps with CSS structure and be more organized basically you have parent CSS like navbar then you have li, so with nesting you don’t have to repeat navbar CSS code to li CSS as it is not needed for it as li Code is connected to its patent CSS code navbar. Next, I learned about mixins, they reusable code blocks they extremely useful for repeating a style to other sections such as text boxes without having to repeat the code for it as mixins contains the code for it. For inheritance it was hardest for me to understand from what I have being able to work out it allows you share styles from one CSS area of code to another CSS code it is similar to mixin. The difference between mixin and inheritance is that mixin includes a set of styles anywhere while in nheritance applies styles from one to another.
