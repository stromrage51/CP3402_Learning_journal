# Learning Activities
This week, I developed a local website based on the HTML website from Practical 01. I converted the CSS code of the HTML website to Sass, incorporating variables, nesting, mixins, and extend/inheritance. I learned how to set up the compiler required to convert the Sass code to CSS code in the main.css file from the video Sass Tutorial for Beginners - CSS With Superpowers. Additionally, I gained insights from the lecture slides about Sass variables, which facilitate easier changes to CSS code by providing easier access. These variables are typically used for colors and font sizes.

Regarding Sass nesting, I learned that it helps with CSS structure and organization. For instance, parent CSS like navbar can be nested, and then specific elements like list items (li) can inherit properties without the need to repeat the navbar CSS code for each li element. Next, mixins were explored, which are reusable code blocks. They are extremely useful for applying a style to multiple sections, such as text boxes, without duplicating code.

Inheritance was initially challenging for me to grasp, but I understood that it allows sharing styles from one CSS code area to another. It is somewhat similar to mixins, but the main difference lies in how styles are applied. Mixins include a set of styles anywhere, while inheritance applies styles from one to another.

Using Sass emphasized the importance of naming conventions. Well-named classes, like "team-card" and "team-card-img," facilitate easier nesting.  

# Estimated Hours
I dedicated approximately 12 hours and 30 minutes to learning about Sass code this week, excluding time spent on assignments.

# Content Insights
The introduction to Sass code provided valuable insights for future website development. Managing CSS code with Sass is significantly easier, as changes to one variable can alter the entire website's style. Unlike traditional CSS, Sass allows for structured code organization, simplifying editing and reducing redundancy. Overall, the benefits of using Sass for CSS coding are indispensable for efficient website development.

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Understanding Sass enhances career prospects in web development by enabling developers to efficiently manage and organize CSS code. Learning Sass not only improves employability but also enhances coding skills, making developers more adept at creating scalable and maintainable websites.
