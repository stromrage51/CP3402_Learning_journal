# Learning Activities
This week I created a local website that is based on Prac 01 html website, the CSS code of html website was converted to SaaS which includes having variables, nesting, mixins and extend/inheritance. I learned from the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a5j7KoflTs Sass Tutorial for Beginners - CSS With Superpowers how to do the compiler which was needed to convert the SaaS code to CSS code in the main.css file. I learned from the lecture slides about SaaS variables which allowed easier changes to made to the CSS code due to easier access they are generally used for colours and font sizes. While SaaS nesting, I learned helps with CSS structure and be more organized basically you have parent CSS like navbar then you have li, so with nesting you don’t have to repeat navbar CSS code to li CSS as it is not needed for it as li Code is connected to its patent CSS code navbar. Next, I learned about mixins, they reusable code blocks they extremely useful for repeating a style to other sections such as text boxes without having to repeat the code for it as mixins contains the code for it. For inheritance it was hardest for me to understand from what I have being able to work out it allows you share styles from one CSS area of code to another CSS code it is similar to mixin. The difference between mixin and inheritance is that mixin includes a set of styles anywhere while in inheritance applies styles from one to another. Also using SaaS made realizing how important naming is as naming class better names connections like “team-card” and “team-card-img” allows doing nesting easier.   

# Estimated Hours
In total spent 12 hours on 30 minutes on this subject this week on SASS code that is not included the assigment. 

# Content Insights
An introduction to SaaS code was good insight for future websites as it is easier to manage CSS code with SaaS as you only must change one variable to change the website entire website style instead of old method of changing the code for each section. While CSS code is easier to use for experiments, it is better to use SaaS code as helps with structure of CSS code and makes editing so much easier also less cluster and must importantly allow me not having repeat the code multiple times in each CSS code section. Overall, the benefits of having SaaS code is must essential to have for the coding as it allows for easier CSS code editing.
