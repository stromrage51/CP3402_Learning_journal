# Learning Activities

When trying to the pratical i realzied that i won't be able to import my static html website to Joomla was quite diffuclut. The easy part was connecting Joomla to siteground trying to change the template style was the hard part. I learned their was two ways to this one was altering the html files indivally on visual studio was long and tediuos so in popular produceure i choose the second option to recreating the html file in nicepage which did the template file for me. I found the the youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7OGqlAm__k to be very helpful to explain how to change the file so it can be accepted by Joomla. Knowning how to upload the files to nicepage so it be converted to template would be very helpful as i got three locations where the file is located making it apart of the three step process.
