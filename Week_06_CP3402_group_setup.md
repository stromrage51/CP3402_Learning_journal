# Pratical 6
Name: Matthew Ballarino

# Learning Activities
This week I worked with my teammates to create the site tools needed for the assignment. I worked on the group agreement with Jerome on Trello, watched the video “Lecture Recording 06 Project Management Lecture Recording 06 Project Management” on learn JCU to understand on what to write for the group agreement, I found it to be useful for some of the parts. After the practical I watched some LinkedIn learning videos to become a better team member to better help the team in the group assessment.

# Estimated Hours
In total spent two hours on 30 minutes on this subject this week that’s not included the assignment. 

# Content Insights
I found the pre lecture video useful as it basically tells you what to do for assignment. The practical basically helps you on how to start up the assignment and what to do if having team troubles. The LinkedIn learning videos basically expands upon that knowledge to give more of an explanation on team meetings like how to create a good demo meeting, what makes a good meeting and the importance of timeboxing. Timebox is the activity basically it can’t extend past its requirements, if the timebox is activity during the meeting it can’t go beyond past the meeting. Timeboxing helps predict the project’s time and how everything like delays to project will make the product predictability less predictable and leaving the sponsor unhappy. Overall, the LinkedIn learning videos were helpful along with the lecture videos as they explain the importance on having good team meetings and being consist with the work per meeting.  

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights

After completing the practical I stated to use what I learned doing the practical to better help my team during the team meetings. An example of this would be suggesting a timeline for the assignment for competition on different activities. Another good reason for doing this practical is that helps you in the job force making on a commission with other people as it tells you how to be productive as you can doing the team meetings and what the boss is looking for.
