Name: Matthew Ballarino

# Learning Activities
This week I worked with my teammates to create the site tools needed for the assignment. While working on assignment I learned how to use docker finally, which was something I struggled with. I also learned that is important to clarify what someone is saying as it can lead confusion. I learned to run a WordPress site how locally through docker and not local and understand it instead of having a vaguely understanding of it. Worked with my teammates to help fix a problem with github pull request as it was not working for awhile and nobody known why for a while.

# Estimated Hours
In total spent eight hours on 30 minutes on this subject this week. 

# Content Insights
I found setting up the basic to be easy to do, there was slight initial problems like the GitHub repo like there being two GitHub repo, but problem was quickly fixed. I found using WAMP to be easier to use instead of local and docker, WAMP was suggested to me by my teammates as local webhost. Another idea to help with developing a website is Figma. Figma can be used to develop ideas for the website before going locally to develop website.  

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights

By getting to the habit of creating a Figma website, then run locally then run with WordPress can save a lot of effort. First reason is with Figma I can better visual the website instead going through all the effort of creating new lines of codes and changes, this allows changes to be made easier to website design when using Figma in case teammates donâ€™t like the way it looks. Having when local first allows changes made easier to have change back to what they were previously to fix any mistakes and teams approval.
