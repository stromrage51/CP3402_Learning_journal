# Content Insights
I found doing the child themes easy to do as had previous experince editing the css code for the themes. An example of this would be for prac_04 creating a wordpress site I created custom backgrounds for the theme that I was using. Another thing I learned about child themes is that child themes relay on patent themes for control on functions they have like widgets and any function they have won't work without having the patent theme installed as well.

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
After completing the practical, I relazied that have child themes in wordpress makes edditing websites easier making the website look better. If creating another wordpress website in the futher it will make editing webistes easier to do.
