# Estimated Hours

I spent about the entire week in my own time relearning everything I can about html and CSS. 

# Content Insights

Doing this practical as first one to do is a very good idea as builds upon the skill needed to develop more websites on a more advanced scale. The only two roadblocks that I encountered while doing this practical was the forums and proper login function that is connected to database, as might have created a login page but it doesn’t work as intended as in you can’t use login function as now it is for only display. But in all else the practical has provided a good insight on the set of skills that I need to make a website. This practical also showed me the html and CSS must know knowledge for when making a website. As CSS is used to tell the computer what a particular part of html part like a navbar to look like. Learnt that JavaScript is used to help create custom features on a website like a slideshow.  
    

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
This practical in my opinion will give me a understand on how to make a website using WordPress and Joomla and other website builders and how important that Html, CSS and JavaScript are to process, because they are basic instructions for making websites and without this knowledge making websites is going to become easier. This knowldge would also help making when using WordPress as basic knowledge on CSS is impormant on websites.
